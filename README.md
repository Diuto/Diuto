### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Chidiuto Okorie
I'm a Data Analyst and an Electrical & Electronic Engineering Graduate (major in Telecommunications Engineering). I like to think of myself as a storyteller; an attribute that served as a hobby of mine long before I fell in love with data. Now, I use those skills from my storytelling days to make sense of data and draw interesting insights.

Am I a boring person? I'm so glad you asked!
- I collect data, clean it, observe it carefully to understand it, and tell you what it's saying.
- I'm a DataCamp Certified Data Analyst Associate.
- I'm currently on the lookout for internships and Entry-level roles as a Data Analyst.
- At the moment, I'm learning R so as to make it one of the tools of my shed.
- The fence is a great place to sit, so I often play devil's advocate in conflict situations
- You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chidiuto-okorie-0397a3163/)

So, yeah... probably boring.
